            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version control is one main system that can hold all of the files being used for a certain project.  It makes working on a project in a group much simpler and straightforward so less mistakes are made.  The version control system allows users to know who changed a file, when they did this and what changes were made.  It conveniently allows a group to work on the same file all at the same time and if a mistake does occur, it allows the editor to revert to a past version.  Overall it is a handy tool to help editors work in groups on editing projects without fear of losing data. This is interesting because it seems like a very useful application to help with projects and applies to the class because we will be using GIT which has this version control.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a method that allows files to be saved multiple times as separate files in case a mistake is created at any point, a creator can go back and access the last version that was saved.  It saves the date, time, who made the changes and what changes were made.  GIT is a very notable and widely used type of version control.  Version control thus makes it very simple for a group to work on a project without worrying about messing up the files.  So it creates a history of changes made to a file while still allowing for collaboration in projects.  This is interesting because it shows a very convenient tool for coding and creating in groups.  This could be important for the class to understand how GIT works.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a place where data can be stored and thus holds information for a website.  One type of repository is a remote repository.  A remote repository is a server that is shared among many different team members so that they can all work on files at the same time.  On the other hand, a local repository holds a local server that only one member will use.  Either way, files will be saved on to the repository for safe keeping.  This is interesting because it’s a very important and easy way to make sure files are stored properly and so people can work in groups on projects.  It’s very important for this class because we are learning how to store information on repositories.  </p>

            <p class="lead">A program that facilitates group collaboration and allows it to happen easily.  Git is also very advanced to accommodate a skilled user’s needs.  The goal of GIT is to be high speed, simple to use, strong so that many people can use it at once and be able to handle large projects.  Simply, GIT is a version control system that allows many people to utilize the same project files and store the information on their changes.  GIT only adds data to projects so it makes it very difficult to lose project information and thus makes the creator much more secure in their work knowing it won’t accidentally be lost on a server.  This is interesting and useful for class because we will be using GIT and learning how to navigate the program.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three Stages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to fully understand GIT, one must understand the three stages that a file can exist in.  These three stags are committed, modified, and staged.  Committed is the stage where data can be saved on a local database.  Modified means a creator has modified a file but has not yet saved it to a database.  Staged means that a creator has decided to take a modified file and save it in to the next committed file.  These three stages allow one to understand how working with GIT is completed.  First a file is modified then one chooses which aspects of a file they would like to save and flags them.  Finally, a completed version is decided on and is committed to the GIT directory.  This is particularly interesting because it is very basic lingo and rules for using Git which is a program we are learning to use in this class.</p>
