# Project Description
In this project, I learned the basics of Git, Repositories, and Version Control. I watched several videos and practiced GIT commands and collected five key concepts that I found interesting and relevant to this course.  Once I found those, I wrote a short summary on each and inputed them into my Cloud9 website along with matching pictures.

# Lessons Learned
1) Version Control- Version control is a method of storing files that allows editors to save multiple versions so that several people can work on the same project without accidentally losing information.
2) GIT- GIT is a type of version control that works quickly and has a simple interface to make group collaboration possible.
3) Repository- A repository can be remote or local.  Either way, it stores information for files and allows for multiple versions documenting when the file was saved, who edited and what changes were made.
